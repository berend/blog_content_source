Summary: How to git submodule

**Overview**

I would like to explain how to use submodule within git and what happens in detail. How to fix conlicts and what can go wrong.

I mainly write this up to come back here later and reread this, because I oft have to think hard about this.

So, let us build a sample folder structure. In this example I will use a resources folder as submodule that is intended to be used in different projects. It should contains some images and libaries I use across pro jects.
